# Project 3 Evaluation
[inline code comments]()
## Back-end Technology
**2: Performing**
>Includes 2 models
<!-- Back-end was solid, good job making use of nesting documents. Only thing I'd really do differently is to divide up your routes into controllers -->
## Front-end Technology
**2: Performing**
>Front-end makes appropriate use of React components and state.
<!-- State was redefined too many times on the front end.  Think about where your data lives on the front-end and what components are containers vs presentational.  However, given the size and scope of your project, I think you did an excellent job putting everything together.  Visually very appealing as well.-->
## Code Quality
**2: Performing**
>Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues
<!-- Code mostly very strong, well-named. Little bit of styling issues on the forms and some of the indentation on the front-end. You all would benefit greatly from a little clean up on the front.  -->
## Deployment and Functionality
**2: Performing**
>Application contains no major errors, is deployed correctly, and contains a custom Heroku app name appropriate for the app.
<!-- You all took on a lot! If you have time after project 4, see if you can go back and get the last couple of features working. -->
## Planning / Process / Submission
**3: Excelling**
>Submission includes everything in previous category, as well as evidence of proper teamwork, such as feature branching, code review, github issue / user story tracking, and justification of technical decisions.
<!-- You all worked extremely hard, planned, made use of feature branching and frequent commits.  -->


<!-- Overall you all did an amazing job! This was a big app that you all took on. You all put together a very visually appealing, professional looking, functional app! I especially like the sea creatures! Awesome job figuring out how to navigate through the nested documents, and for figuring out AWS. I know there were a few things towards the end you didn't quite get to, and there is some logic underneath the hood showing up in the console that you didn't quite get around to rendering on the page. Be sure to checkout my comments, especially on the front end, and if you have time, definitely try and add a couple finishing touches.  Great job! -->
